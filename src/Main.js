          Hi! I'm Lindis JÃ¸rgensen, and i currently work as an SEO specialist in
          an Oslo-based agency. I've recently discovered a love for coding, and
          pursued to take a coding workshop at SheCodes, which I completed this
          January. I'm eager to keep learning and take on exciting
          coding-projects, whereas my goal is to be working as a front-end
          developer full time. Check out some of my work below!
